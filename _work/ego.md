When the world looks at Sebastian Silverberg it sees a young man who has it all. When Sebastian looks at the world he sees an abundance of partying, popularity, and sex with beautiful girls. Just around the corner his dream of becoming a successful recording artist is about to come true. But when Sebastian turns that corner, everything changes and suddenly he can no longer see anything.

Sebastian is blinded and is forced to adapt to a new way of life. Without realizing he finds true love for the first time, and when his sight is miraculously restored, he must be brave enough to see past the superficial and deliver a performance that comes straight from the heart.

Ego is a romantic-comedy drama about vanity, love, sex and that things arenâ€™t always what they appear to be.
